#  Project 4 - ContactList

For this project you will be implementing a binary tree for a contact list.

You are given the following files:
binarytree.h/binarytree.cpp - Implement a simple binary tree for this class. 
main.cpp - A file that you should be able to compile to test your classes.

You are allowed to add any public/private variables/member functions as you like as long as you retain and keep the default functions and structs i have provided you.

A simple main.cpp is provided for you to use to iteratively test your class.
To compile run the following (assuming you're in the directory of all files):
g++ main.cpp -std=c++11
To execute your binary run the following (assuming you did not rename the output):
./a.out

When submitting to gradescope you should only submit .cpp and .h files, the main.cpp is not required.
You should only submit to gradescope when you have finished all the required functions.
